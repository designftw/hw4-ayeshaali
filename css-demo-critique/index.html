    <h2>Critique 1: <a href="https://9elements.github.io/fancy-border-radius/full-control.html">Border-Radius</a> </h2>
    
    In terms of learnability, it was actually harder to understand how the simple design worked compared to the full 
    control one, because the full control demo looks more like the mental model I have of a div and its border-radius.
    I like how you can copy the CSS code which helps with efficiency, but it would be helpful if you could change the 
    percentages through typing. It would also help with safety in case you want to try exact numbers rather than moving
    the corners.

    The input fields are all very intuitive which helps with learnability. You can though click on each cell to add 
    a class to it, which is hard to realize at first and I don't see how it really helps. In addition, you can add 
    many classes to one class by repeatedly clicking, but removing all the classes requires just as many clicks, which 
    is inefficient. The reset button doesn't really work which also hurts efficiency, but copying the code is very 
    efficient. The feedback you get from inputting an invalid input is helpful and helps with safety.
